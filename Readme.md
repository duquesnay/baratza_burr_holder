### Thingiverse Description

Baratza burr holder remixed from johnyz's design.

I've made some modifications to make it easier to print, and in the process of that redone the scad file to make it easier to modify.

Changes to model:

- made bottom ring thicker (1.5mm) - it was too thin, printed unevenly and broke when removing supports. I suggest setting it (bottom_thickness parameter) to be equal to 3 times line width
- extended burr holder tabs and sides to the bottom to avoid needing supports (tabs broke off with supports in both initial prints) - this can be changed to original by changing cutouts parameter
- made side tabs thinner - i found they printed fine, instead i broke one off trying to grind/cut it down to fit

Scad file is available on github <https://github.com/michaljbarczewski/baratza_burr_holder>
